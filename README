Galil Tools
-----------

The galil-provided .deb files work fine. However, Debian's new multi-arch
infrastructure does away with lib64/, so if you are using the 64-bit
version, you will need to move or symlink the libraries into lib/:

    pushd /usr/lib/
    sudo ln -s ../lib64/libgalil.so* ../lib64/libGalil.so* ./
